## File:
**Editor:** Adobe Illustrator or SVG editor
* Raster editors are welcomed, but frowned upon for scaling.

**Dimensions:** `192x192` pixels
* Please, no inches or non-square rectangles.

**Vector Save:** .AI or .SVG
* PSDs don't scale well
* Proprietary formats we can't open won't be used.

**Export:** PNG-24 with transparency (PNG 32)

**Pixel Perfection:** Please never use "Align Objects to Pixel Grid". It ruins long shadows and edges as well as positioning. You should instead manually check that all dimensions and positions are all whole numbers.

## Objects:
**Keyline Shapes:**
* Rectangles: `152x152` (Square), `176x128` (Landscape), `128x176` (Portrait)
  * `12px` Radius rounded corners
* Circle: `176x176`

**Maximum Area:** `176x176`

**Raised Objects:** *Need:* Long shadows, tints, shades, and drop shadows [*(See Raised Objects)*](#raised-objects)

**Finish:** *Need:* On very top layer, special radial gradient, fills the icon's silhouette [*(See Finish)*](#finish)

**Whole Icon:** *Need:* Tint, shade, drop shadow, raised object shadows clipped off if applicable [*(See Whole Icon)*](#whole-icon)

## Crease:
* Composed of two lines that are each the width of the object and 1px tall
* Darker line should be the top, where the top down light wouldn't have as much of a direct effect.
* 5% opacity shade color for top, 5% white for bottom (Unless the object it too light). 

## Colors:
* Material Design Palette colors as much as possible. (some greens and special colors don't apply)
* Limit use of gradient spots or objects (excluding lighting effects, -45Â° only)
* Shade, drop Shadows, and long shadows have the appropriate shade color for the object it is on (not necessarily the object where lighting effect is from)

## Text:
* Use Roboto for generic text, logo font or path for specialized text. (logos for Pandora, Facebook, etc)
* `Create Outlines` before creating long shadows, drop shadows, tints, shades, or aligning.
* `Make Compound Path` before creating tints or shades

## Long Shadows:
**Gradient:** 
* Type: `Linear`
* Starting Node: `20% Opacity` *Color:* `Shade Color`
* Gradient Slider Midpoint: `Position 50%`
* Angle: `-45 degrees`

Type One:
* End Node: `5% Opacity` *Color:* `Shade Color`

Type Two:
* End Node: `0% Opacity` *Color:* `Shade Color`

**Shape:** Created by using a `Blend` *from* a copy of the object at its original location *to* a copy of the object transformed -45 degrees with the outside anchors completely off the artboard (canvas)
* Blend: Use `Specified Steps` and pick a higher number for higher accuracy (for curvature)
  * More than 50 but less than 500 steps
  * `Pathfinder` > `Crop` using a copy of to the object(s) it's on
    * Remove the outline and leave the other objects(s)
  * Use the `Lasso Tool` in `Isolation Mode` to eliminate extra anchors that cause a staircase effect or awkward curvature

## Raised Objects:
**Tint and Shade:** Use the `Difference` (`Minus`) of two copies of the object separated vertically by a pixel
* Don't use duplicate objects and use them without making it the difference and realigned onto the object
* [Use these helpful `Actions` for creating and aligning tints and shades](https://goo.gl/pguAcr)

**Tint:**
* Use 20% opacity white for all colors but Gray 50 to Gray 300
* Use 40% opacity white for Gray 50 to Gray 300 (100% when tint looks better on Gray 50 only)

**Shade:** 
* Must have at least one shade, preferred to have both.

Type One:
* Shade on the object on the last pixel up against the edge.

Type Two:
* If doesn't touch the outside perimeter (or transparency in case of glass effect): 1px below the object that creates the light effect.

* Don't leave a gap between the shade and the object

**Crease:** Avoid folding or creasing the raised object if you do the object below without aligning them correctly

**Drop Shadow:**

Metrics:
* Mode: `Normal`

Type One (-45 Degree):
* `4px` offset for both X and Y (For the -45 degree lighting)

Type Two (Top Down):
* `0px` X and `4px` Y offset
* `4px` blur
* Colors: `Shade color`

* Clip off the shadows if they extend past the icon's perimeter
* Use long and drop shadow [*(See Long Shadow)*](#long-shadow)

## Finish:
Radial gradient overlay on the top layer of the icon

**Gradient:**
* Mode: `Radial`
* Starting Node: `10% Opacity` *Color:* `White`
* Gradient Slider Midpoint: `Position 33%` (Spec Material) **or**
* Gradient Slider Midpoint: `Position 50%` (In Google's Icons)
* End Node: `0% Opacity` *Color:* `White`
* Angle: `-45 degrees`
* Shouldn't create white outside of the icon

Type One:
* Radial Circle: Covers the entire icon perimeter (not including drop shadows), extends from top left corner of icon silhouette
* Starting Point: Center of circle, top left corner of icon silhouette

Type Two:
* Radial Circle: Covers the entire icon perimeter (not including drop shadows)
* Starting Point: Moved over at far as it can go towards the -45 indicator handle

## Whole Icon:
Shouldn't extend past the `8px margin` on all for side of the icon for a max area of `176x176` pixels

**Drop Shadow:** 

Type One:

Single shade added to icon layer or group
* Shadow:
  * Mode: `Normal`
  * `0px` offset for X and a `4px` for Y
  * `4px` blur
  * Color: `black` (#000000, not #202020)

Type Two:

Add two fills to the appearance of the icon layer or group
* Stroke Color: No stroke
* Fill Color: `White`
* Mode: `Multiply`
* Top Shadow:
  * Mode: `Multiply`
  * `0px` offset for both X and Y
  * `2px` blur
  * Color: `black` (#000000, not #202020)
* Bottom Shadow:
  * Mode: `Multiply`
  * `0px` offset for X and a `4px` for Y
  * `2px` blur
  * Color: `black` (#000000, not #202020)

* Make sure the objects making the outside perimeter of the icon have a tint and shade that are on the object
* If there is a drop shadow for a glyph that extends off of the icon, clip it so it doesn't interact with the whole icon's drop shadow

## Icon Complexity:
* Don't over complicate the icons with excessive raised object
  * Think wisely about using more than two (including keyline or base shape)
* Don't and too many spot colors that won't scale well for lower densities.
